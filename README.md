# codemirror-vim-mode
Vim Mode for CodeMirror 6 (work in progress - just getting started).

Scope of the project:

 * Provide the most widely used Vim interactions to _make Vim users feel at home_ in the editor.
 * The aim is _not_ to implement every single feature that exists in the original Vim.

See [Kanban](https://github.com/vizhub-open-core/codemirror-vim-mode/projects/1).

This is a community effort. PRs and issues welcome!
